Includes table creation, constraints, data insertion, and retrieval using MySQL.  
Focused on practical data handling concepts with examples like the student admissions database.

## üß† About the Project
This project helps understand the fundamentals of **data handling using SQL**.  
It includes examples of how to:
- Create and use databases
- Define tables with appropriate data types
- Apply constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, and `DEFAULT`
- Insert, retrieve, and manage records efficiently
- Use `ENUM` for fixed categories and `TIMESTAMP` for record tracking

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Example: ADMISSIONS
The database `ADMISSIONS` includes a table named `RECORDS` to store student details.

### Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS RECORDS (
    ENROLLMENT_NO VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    GENDER ENUM('MALE', 'FEMALE', 'OTHER') DEFAULT 'OTHER',
    GMAIL VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    DATE_OF_BIRTH DATE NOT NULL,
    CREATED_AT TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
